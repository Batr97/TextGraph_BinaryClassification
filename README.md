# TextGraph_BinaryClassification


## Introduction
This repository contains the code for training and testing a Graph Attention Network (GAT) model on a dataset. The GAT model is implemented using the Deep Graph Library (DGL).

## Requirements
Before running the code, make sure you have installed DGL. You can install it via pip:
```pip install dgl```


## Data Preparation
To run the GAT model on your dataset, you need to apply the data preparation process to both the train and test datasets.

## Training
For training the GAT model, you can run the `train.ipynb` notebook. This notebook contains the code for training the model on the prepared training dataset.

## Testing
To acquire predictions on the test dataset, you can run the `test_score.ipynb` notebook. This notebook contains the code for evaluating the trained model on the test dataset and generating predictions.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed before running the code.
- Modify the notebook code as needed to suit your specific dataset and requirements.
